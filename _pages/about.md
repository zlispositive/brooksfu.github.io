I am a postdoctoral scholar at California Institute of Technology in the research groups of [Prof. Ralph Adolphs](http://emotion.caltech.edu/) and [Prof. Ueli Rutishauser](https://www.rutishauserlab.org/). I am also a visiting postdoctoral scholar at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. My primary research interest is mechanisms of decision making and learning in humans. I collaborate with Drs. Adam Mamelak, Jeffrey Chung and Chrystal Reed at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where we record single-unit activity and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from epilepsy patients.

I investigate cognitive mechanisms using a wide range of approaches: behavioral studies, scalp EEG and intracranial EEG, human single-unit recordings as well as mathematical modeling. My thesis work is done in collaboration with Profs. Ralph Adolph and Ueli Rutishauser where I investigated the relationship between single-unit activity and event-related potentials in conflict tasks. I am also actively pursuing my research interest in understanding decision-making and learning in financial markets, as well as applying what we learn from the brain to artificial intelligence.
